Here is a natural English translation I made of the Mandukya Upanishad:

<pre>

1
this syllable "AUM" is all this
	here is the explanation
		past present future is all AUM
		and that beyond past present future
					is AUM too.
2
all this indeed is brahma
	this atma is brahma
		and has
		four quarters.

3
the waking state
	with consciousness turned outward
	with seven limbs and nineteen mouths
		enjoyer of gross objects
			is the first quarter
			Vaisvanara.

4
the dream state
	with consciousness turned inward
	with seven limbs and nineteen mouths
		enjoyer of subtle objects
			is the second quarter
			Taijasa.

5
where one is asleep
	with no desires wanted
	and no dreams seen
		this is deep sleep.
the deep sleep state
	with single-pointed being
	as a blob of consciousness
		made of happiness
		enjoyer of happiness
		at the doorway to the conscious
			is the third quarter
			Prajna.

6
this is the all-ruler
	the all-knower
	the inner controller
	the source of everything
	the beginning and end
		of all beings.

7
not consciousness turned inward nor turned outward
	nor turned both inward and outward
	not a blob of consciousness
	not consciousness
	not unconsciousness
	unseen
	untransactable
	ungraspable
	unmarked
	unthinkable
	undesignable
	its essence is knowledge of the one atma
	all phenomena coming to rest
	peaceful
	auspicious
	nondual
	the fourth
		is the atma
		and is to be understood.

8
this self with respect to syllables
	is "AUM" with respect to its letters
	the quarters are the letters
	and the letters are the quarters
			A, U, M.

9
the waking state
	Vaisvanara
	A
	first letter
	reaches all
	and is first.
whoever understands this
	reaches all desires
	and becomes the first.

10
the dream state
	Taijasa
	U
	second letter
	heightens
	and is in between.
whoever understands this
	heightens the flow of knowledge
	and becomes in between
	no non-knower of brahma will ever exist
	in their family.

10
the deep sleep state
	Prajna
	M
	third letter
	measures
	and absorbs.
whoever understands this
	measures all
	and absorbs all.

11
letterless is the fourth
	untransactable
	all phenomena coming to rest
	auspicious
	nondual
	AUM
	the atma.
whoever understands this
indeed whoever understands this
	enters the atma
through the atma.

om shanti, shanti, shanti.
