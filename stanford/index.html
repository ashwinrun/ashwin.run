"During his time at Stanford, he was actively involved with the Chinese Students Club and, after witnessing an instance of prejudice in which a Chinese student was physically thrown out of the Encina Hall dormitory due to his race, assisted with the successful fundraising efforts for the Stanford Chinese Clubhouse, which became the campus residence for students of Chinese descent.

"A student of Chinese decent was physically thrown out of the residences at Encina Hall by white male students.

"A student of Chinese descent was physically thrown out of the residences at Encina Hall by white male students. This action prompted the Chinese and Japanese communities at Stanford to raise funds to establish residences on campus for their students in 1919 and 1916 respectively." https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/466171/API-History-at-Stanford-and-beyond/

"When a Chinese freshman attempted to move into the dorms at Encina Hall in 1918, he was bodily thrown out by white students. The outraged Chinese community rallied to fund the construction of a clubhouse on campus, where Chinese students could live while studying at Stanford. Chinese students and members of the Chinese business community worked together to buy a house on campus and rebuild it. Originally located on Salvatierra, where the Stanford Law School stands today, the Chinese Clubhouse was torn down in 1971 to make way for more University construction. Just as much of Asian American history has been papered over, the communityâ€™s tangible heritage on campus was demolished." https://stanforddaily.com/2022/05/31/from-the-community-stanfords-history-is-inextricably-linked-with-asian-american-history/
