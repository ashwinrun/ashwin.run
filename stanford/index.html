"During his time at Stanford, he was actively involved with the Chinese Students Club and, after witnessing an instance of prejudice in which a Chinese student was physically thrown out of the Encina Hall dormitory due to his race, assisted with the successful fundraising efforts for the Stanford Chinese Clubhouse, which became the campus residence for students of Chinese descent.

"A student of Chinese decent was physically thrown out of the residences at Encina Hall by white male students. This action prompted the Chinese and Japanese communities at Stanford to raise funds to establish residences on campus for their students." https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9r29s431/entire_text/

"A student of Chinese descent was physically thrown out of the residences at Encina Hall by white male students. This action prompted the Chinese and Japanese communities at Stanford to raise funds to establish residences on campus for their students in 1919 and 1916 respectively." https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/466171/API-History-at-Stanford-and-beyond/

"When a Chinese freshman attempted to move into the dorms at Encina Hall in 1918, he was bodily thrown out by white students. The outraged Chinese community rallied to fund the construction of a clubhouse on campus, where Chinese students could live while studying at Stanford. Chinese students and members of the Chinese business community worked together to buy a house on campus and rebuild it. Originally located on Salvatierra, where the Stanford Law School stands today, the Chinese Clubhouse was torn down in 1971 to make way for more University construction. Just as much of Asian American history has been papered over, the community’s tangible heritage on campus was demolished." https://stanforddaily.com/2022/05/31/from-the-community-stanfords-history-is-inextricably-linked-with-asian-american-history/

"In the graduate school of journalism, which was very expensive, I was no longer a big campus figure. It was time to just learn academically, although I learned much in campus activities at San Jose. I studied, working two jobs—washing dishes at a dormitory and selling games tickets, and lived at the Chinese Clubhouse which housed about 20 students.

Here was another kind of experience. Many of the students were already well educated from Chinese universities and from wealthy and established families. We Chinese Americans came from parents who, being peasant stock, came to America to better themselves. But we all lived together and learned to get along because we were all Chinese.

At that time, although the Chinese Clubhouse was located on “fraternity row”, two streets of large handsome residential structures which had various fraternities or men’s organizations, no Chinese belonged nor therefore lived in them. Chinese cooks, however, worked in many of them." - https://gumsaanjournal.com/special-edition-2021-the-eagle-and-the-dragon/the-eagle-and-the-dragon/
