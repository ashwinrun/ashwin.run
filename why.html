Motivation for making this website:

<ul>
<li>Sometimes writing things down helps keep your thoughts in order and synthesize the information you've gotten from diverse sources. It also gives some level of permanence to wisdom and insights you have accumulated within, so you don't forget everything as life goes on.</li>
<li>There are many conversations that I have over and over again (such as tips for studying for the LSAT) and it would be much easier to have a web link I can point people to for reference.</li>
<li>For the things I am adding to this website, I have never read anything like it posted by anyone else before, so hopefully this helps other people who have similar questions, insights, or ideas to connect. It takes courage to share and display parts of yourself publicly, but if that helps other people, it's definitely worth it.</li>
</ul>

Also, simple HTML files and hyperlinks harkens back to the beginning of the Internet and keeps the focus on the content, not the layout.
