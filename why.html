Motivation for making this website: sometimes writing things down helps keep your thoughts in order. And gives some level of permanence and ability to share any wisdom and insights you have accumulated within. Finally, for the things I am adding to this website, I have never read anything like it posted by anyone else before, so hopefully this helps other people who have similar questions, insights, or ideas.
