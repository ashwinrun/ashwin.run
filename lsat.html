Here is how I studied for the LSAT. I took a diagnostic where I got in the low-160s, studied for 1.5 months, and ultimately got a 174. I took the LSAT in January 2021.

<ul>
    <li>Took a diagnostic test on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/prep/lsat">Khan Academy</a>. I also did some practice problems there. Khan Academy lets you set a time range and a goal, then gives you periodic practice sections and LSAT full tests. I usually used Khan Academy as a way to more easily mark my progress, as it would make me take full-length practice tests every few weeks and made a chart that tracked my LSAT score progress. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/lsat/lsat-lessons/about-official-lsat-prep/a/list-of-lsat-practice-tests-available-on-khan-academy">This page</a> was also helpful, as it lists out which LSAT practice tests are used by the platform, so you can ensure you don't take them again when practicing elsewhere.</li>
    <li>I wasn't very good at logic games, so started focusing on that. I read through the <a href="https://shop.powerscore.com/books?id=a08E0000016xg1sIAA">PowerScore LSAT Logic Games Bible</a> to understand the general strategy.</li>
    <li>I bought <a href="https://www.lsac.org/lawhub">LSAT PrepPlus</a> ($100 / year). This was very useful because it has all the former LSAT practice tests, and it lets you use the official testing interface that online LSAT Flex tests use.</li>
    <li>I also bought a <a href="https://7sage.com/pricing/">7Sage subscription</a>. They have really good videos teaching concepts. But in my case, I used 7Sage solely for the problem explanations. Particularly, after taking a section or full practice test, I would go through each question to ensure I understood why I got it wrong. If I didn't understand, I would watch the 7Sage explanation video to ensure that I did.</li>
</ul>

I also used <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w0nRXmArkMPgcq-nPvNXmRGneqwnB6a0kYGa-dINqBg/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> to track my progress:
