Advaita Vedanta posits that "Tat Tvam Asi" -- the ultimate unity of the individual Atman and total Brahman.

Things I want to talk about:

<ul>
    <li>how advaita vedanta is compatible with complete determinism (free will -- the false sense of "I" -- is an illusion)</li>
    <li>the traditional de-emphasis, and recent emphasis, on historicity when considering Hindu legends and traditions</li>
    <li>can re-evaluating the role of shruti provide a satisfactory response to Ambedkar's challenge in <em>Annihilation of Caste</em>?</li>
</ul>
