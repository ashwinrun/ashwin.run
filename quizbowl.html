Our logic: they would have plenty of time to do it! And if everyone did this, we would see huge improvements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>But reality sinks in. Summer is long. No work; no practices; no reminders to study. Inevitably, not a single person finished all the homework, even though we had a common checklist. And that brings me to the major problem facing our team (and every other quizbowl team that ever existed) &ndash; </span><span class="c2">motivation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every team requires dedication and motivation from their players. Teams achieve this in different ways: attending competitive tournaments, holding tryouts, and taking quizzes are only some of them. However, although it may be easy to mobilize a team to study right before a tournament, maintaining consistent study habits is hard. It is rare to see someone, even from the top teams, who can say that they study every day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overcoming this problem, in fact, is essential from the very beginning of the quizbowl experience. High school quizbowl has a steep learning curve for most freshmen, even those who have already played in middle school. It takes dedication to begin to start studying. It is hard to get good &ndash; unless you have a clear goal of where you want to be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Take my case. When I started quizbowl as a freshman, I didn&rsquo;t study very much. But then, in the summer of freshman year, the seniors told us that they needed a fourth player who knew science and RMP. This gave me the drive to study. My team actually needed me &ndash; and I could make a difference!</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span>Where to start? The quizbowl canon is huge. Naturally, I began to look for shortcuts. I looked up philosophers, scientific theorems, and more on Quinterest and looked at the most frequent clues for them (so-called &ldquo;stock clues&rdquo;). I put the clues into flashcards, using the spaced memorization program </span><span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ankisrs.net/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1655260262166687&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ny9o_Qs1B-41UZcM7YvPd">Anki</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to manage my studying every day. And after a little less than a week, I began to first-line tossups in my subject against the seniors. In fact, I improved more in that week than I did in my entire freshman year! These quick returns impelled me to study more; you could call this an &ldquo;exponential stage.&rdquo; By the end of sophomore year I had amassed almost 10,000 flashcards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As time went on, though, I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t doing enough. I wasn&rsquo;t understanding what I learned &ndash; or really connecting the dots. Even if I mastered all the clues for &ldquo;cholesterol&rdquo;, I couldn&rsquo;t power a tossup on &ldquo;LDL.&rdquo; I could first-line &ldquo;Grieg&rdquo; but couldn&rsquo;t power a tossup on one of Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies. I wasn&rsquo;t mastering my subject &ndash; I was just randomly learning clues that I hoped would come up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Plus, this wasn&rsquo;t too fun. &ldquo;Back to studying flash cards?&rdquo; my friends would ask me after I finished a tournament. Was reviewing hundreds of flash cards really what I wanted to do with my life? Although I had initially studied diligently, I began to lose interest, my quizbowl studying becoming more intermittent. Overall, my progress that year began to level off, kind of like this:</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 401.99px; height: 267.29px;"><img alt="" src="image1.png" style="width: 401.99px; height: 267.29px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In junior year, though, I realized something &ndash; reading about something or learning it in school was much more effective (and fun) than remembering flashcards. So, I began to read and learn things more often. I focused on learning every bit of the advanced science courses at my school and planned to take more courses through Dual Enrollment. With this attitude, I am able to study for quizbowl in a completely different way. Instead of sitting down to review a hundred flashcards, I just sit down and learn. If something seems interesting, I read about it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a result, not only do I understand clues in more context, but I am able to consistently study every day. Tossups are no longer clues to memorize &ndash; they are suggestions for what to read about next, what to learn about next. I enjoy learning about and understanding the ideas of great scientists and thinkers. My motivation is back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Generally, quizbowlers are motivated by many things: playing at nationals, being the best on the team, not letting one&rsquo;s teammates down. But note how all these factors are temporary. Will winning nationals really be the most important thing in your life when you are at college and beyond? What I appreciate about my journey of learning is that it requires </span><span class="c2">no external motivation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to continue. Yes, playing with my friends and working as a team is a wonderful experience. But my success in quizbowl has become a side effect, not a primary motivation, for my learning, which is a process that will continue for life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So: I think it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind your goal when you study. At first look, quizbowl may seem like memorization of a bunch of facts. But if you&rsquo;re doing it right, it really isn&rsquo;t. These are just some of my thoughts; but whether you are helping other players or getting better yourself, I hope you ask yourself: why are you really studying?</span></p></body></html>
