<h1>Pongal recipe</h1>

This is the recipe I use to make pongal with side dishes.

<p>I usually use an instant pot and put water in the bottom. Then I use smaller containers to create three layers:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Bottom layer:</strong> Equal amounts of brown rice and split moong dal, added with water (so the water line is around a centimeter above the food)</li>
    <li><strong>Middle layer:</strong> Split toor dal, vegetables, water. In the pictures below, I use spinach.</li>
    <li><strong>Top layer:</strong> Some plain rice in a cup, cut vegetables. In the pictures below, I use bitter gourd and taro.</li>
</ol>

Then I pressure cook it on high for around 20 minutes. After it is finished pressure cooking, I make three dishes using a cast-iron skillet:

<ol>
    <li><strong>Pongal:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Put ghee in the skillet on the stove</li>
            <li>Add cut ginger pieces, black peppercorns, split cashews, cumin
                seeds and let it cook / brown</li>
            <li>Add the cooked rice + split moong bean</li>
            <li>Add turmeric powder and salt; mix well and let it cook</li>
            <li>Then the pongal is ready!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sambar:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Put oil in the skillet</li>
            <li>Add fenugreek seeds let it cook / brown</li>
            <li>Add the toor dal + vegetables</li>
            <li>Add turmeric powder, sambar powder, tamarind paste, and salt, mix well and let it cook</li>
            <li>Then the sambar is ready!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Put oil in the skillet</li>
            <li>Add mustard seeds and whole urud dal, let it cook / brown</li>
            <li>Add the vegetables</li>
            <li>Add turmeric powder, sambar powder, and salt, mix well and let it cook</li>
            <li>Then the vegetables are ready!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
